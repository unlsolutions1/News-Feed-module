News Feed module for financial portal allowing to adjust news placement. Our team created multiple news blocks and performed Bitrix integration.

2 dedicated PHP developers, 2-month cooperation

Technologies: PHP, Symfony

Industry: News

# Challenge
The client, one of the largest financial portals in ru.net, turned to us for a consultation on his outdated Bitrix-based website. It featured slow performance and impossibility of further development. However, a news feed was its greatest bottleneck. Being one of the central parts of the website it critically required improvement and customization.

Given the limited budget, lack of in-house IT skills, and the urgency, the client wanted to find the best solution in terms of cost, time and functionality. He was looking to eliminate the critical issues and make the site maintainable, upgrade and grow it further. Once he got an optimal roadmap for the desired solution, he assigned our team to implement it.

# Our solution
Our business analyst and designer planned the logic of the solution. They outlined the right structure of the news section that eliminated clutter. We adjusted the positioning of the news blocks, and make it user-friendly. After the client approved the offered UI our team coded the News Feed section from scratch.

We created a separate API for news retrieval and generation using RabbitMQ message broker software for block cashing. News is shown in different places on a web page in a custom way and can be easily updated in blocks and widgets through the administration panel.

# Outcome
The client got a functional API that was developed in full compliance with his core Bitrix website and features a user-friendly news display and an easily managed administration panel.

It took 2 months for our developers to deliver the needed functionality. Symfony framework allowed creating both maintainable and upgradable solution that goes in line with the client's goals i.e migration of the whole portal to PHP in the long run.
